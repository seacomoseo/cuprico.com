The Management / Governing Body of **INSTALACIONES ELÉCTRICAS TORNERO Y LORENTE S.L.** (hereinafter, the data controller) assumes the highest responsibility and commitment to the establishment, implementation, and maintenance of this Data Protection Policy, ensuring the continuous improvement of the data controller with the aim of achieving excellence in compliance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119/1, 04-05-2016), and the Spanish regulations on personal data protection (Organic Law, specific sectoral legislation, and its implementing regulations).

The Data Protection Policy of **INSTALACIONES ELÉCTRICAS TORNERO Y LORENTE S.L.** is based on the principle of proactive responsibility, whereby the data controller is responsible for compliance with the regulatory and jurisprudential framework governing this Policy and is able to demonstrate it to the competent supervisory authorities.

In this regard, the data controller will be governed by the following principles, which must serve as a guide and reference framework for all its staff in the processing of personal data:

- **Data protection by design**: the data controller will apply, both at the time of determining the means of processing and at the time of the processing itself, appropriate technical and organizational measures, such as pseudonymization, designed to effectively implement data protection principles, such as data minimization, and to integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing.
- **Data protection by default**: the data controller will apply appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that, by default, only the personal data necessary for each of the specific purposes of the processing are processed.
- **Data protection throughout the information lifecycle**: measures to ensure the protection of personal data will be applicable throughout the entire lifecycle of the information.
- **Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency**: personal data will be processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently in relation to the data subject.
- **Purpose limitation**: personal data will be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and will not be further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes.
- **Data minimization**: personal data will be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.
- **Accuracy**: personal data will be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step will be taken to ensure that inaccurate personal data, with regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay.
- **Storage limitation**: personal data will be kept in a form which permits the identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes of the personal data processing.
- **Integrity and confidentiality**: personal data will be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, by using appropriate technical or organizational measures.
- **Information and training**: one of the keys to ensuring the protection of personal data is the training and information provided to the staff involved in their processing. Throughout the information lifecycle, all staff with access to the data will be properly trained and informed about their obligations regarding compliance with data protection regulations.

The Data Protection Policy of **INSTALACIONES ELÉCTRICAS TORNERO Y LORENTE S.L.** is communicated to all staff of the data controller and made available to all interested parties.

As a result, this Data Protection Policy involves all staff of the data controller, who must be aware of it and take ownership of it, considering it as their own, with each member being responsible for applying it and verifying the data protection rules applicable to their activity, as well as identifying and contributing improvement opportunities they consider appropriate in order to achieve excellence in compliance.

This Policy will be reviewed by the Management / Governing Body of **INSTALACIONES ELÉCTRICAS TORNERO Y LORENTE S.L.** as often as deemed necessary to adapt it, at all times, to the provisions in force regarding personal data protection.
