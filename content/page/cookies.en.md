Welcome to the **COOKIE POLICY** of the website of the entity INSTALACIONES ELÉCTRICAS TORNERO Y LORENTE S.L., holder of NIF B21972351, where we will explain in clear and simple language all the necessary details so that you can have control over them based on your personal decisions.

## What are cookies and what do we use them for?

A cookie is a small information file that is stored on your computer, smartphone, or tablet each time you visit our website.

In principle, a cookie is harmless: it does not contain viruses, trojans, worms, etc., that could damage your device, but it does have some impact on your right to the protection of your personal data, since it collects certain information about you (browsing habits, identity, preferences, etc.).

That is why, in accordance with applicable regulations (LSSI and current personal data protection regulations), the activation of certain types of cookies will require your prior consent.

Before doing so, we will give you some additional information to help you make better decisions in this regard:

### Cookies can be of several types depending on their purpose:

- Technical cookies are necessary for our website to function, they do not require your consent, and they are the only ones we have enabled by default.

- The rest of the cookies are used to improve our website, to personalize it based on your preferences, or to be able to show you advertising tailored to your searches, tastes, and personal interests. You can accept all these cookies by clicking the **ACCEPT** button, reject them by clicking the **REJECT** button, or configure them by clicking the **COOKIE SETTINGS** section.

### First-party and third-party cookies

Some cookies are ours (called **first-party cookies**) and others belong to external companies that provide services for our website (called **third-party cookies**: an example would be cookies from external providers such as Google). In this regard, it is important for you to know that some of these external providers may be located outside Spain.

Globally, not all countries have the same level of data protection, with some countries being safer than others (for example, the European Union is a safe environment for your data). Our policy is to use trusted providers who, regardless of whether or not they are located in the European Union, have adopted adequate safeguards to protect your personal information. However, in the section entitled "[What types of cookies are currently used on our website?](#what-types-of-cookies-are-currently-used-on-our-website)", you can review the different privacy and data protection policies of each of the aforementioned external providers, in order to make an informed decision about whether or not to enable the **third-party cookies** used on our website.

### Session and persistent cookies

Finally, note that, depending on how long they remain active, cookies can be of two types:

- **Session cookies:** automatically expire when you end your session on your computer, smartphone, or tablet. They are usually used to retain the necessary information while providing you with a service on a single occasion.

- **Persistent cookies:** remain stored on your computer, smartphone, or tablet for a certain period of time, which may range from a few minutes to several years.

## What types of cookies can we use on our website?

### Technical Cookies

Technical cookies are strictly necessary for our website to function and for you to be able to navigate it. This type of cookie is what allows us, for example, to identify you, give you access to certain restricted areas of the site if necessary, or remember different options or services already selected by you, such as your privacy preferences. Therefore, **they are enabled by default and do not require your consent**.

Through your browser settings, you can block or alert about the presence of this type of cookie, although such blocking will affect the proper functioning of the different features of our website.

### Analytics Cookies

Analytics cookies allow us to study the browsing behavior of users on our website in general (for example, which sections of the site are most visited, which services are used most, and whether they work properly, etc.).

Based on statistical information about browsing on our website, we can improve both the operation of the site itself and the different services it offers. Therefore, these cookies **are not used for advertising purposes**, but only to help our website function better, adapting to our users in general. By enabling them, you will contribute to this continuous improvement.

**You can enable or disable these cookies by checking the corresponding box**, as they are disabled by default.

### Functionality and Personalization Cookies

Functionality cookies allow us to remember your preferences to personalize certain features and general options of our website each time you access it (for example, the language in which information is presented, sections marked as favorites, your type of browser, etc.).

Therefore, these cookies **are not used for advertising purposes**, but by enabling them, you will improve the functionality of the website (for example, adapting to your type of browser) and the personalization of the same based on your preferences (for example, presenting information in the language you have chosen in previous occasions), which will contribute to the ease, usability, and comfort of our site during your browsing.

**You can enable or disable these cookies by checking the corresponding box**, as they are disabled by default.

### Advertising Cookies

Advertising cookies allow us to manage the advertising spaces included on our website based on criteria such as the content displayed or the frequency with which ads are shown.

For example, if the same ad has been shown to you several times on our website and you have not shown personal interest by clicking on it, it will not appear again. In short, by enabling this type of cookie, the advertising shown on our website will be more useful and diverse, and less repetitive.

**You can enable or disable these cookies by checking the corresponding box**, as they are disabled by default.

### Behavioral Advertising Cookies

Behavioral advertising cookies allow us to obtain information based on the observation of your browsing habits and behaviors on the web, in order to show you advertising content that best suits your tastes and personal interests.

To make it very easy to understand, here is a fictional example: if your latest web searches were related to thriller literature, we would show you ads about thriller books.

Therefore, by enabling this type of cookie, the advertising we show you on our website will not be generic, but tailored to your searches, tastes, and interests, thus exclusively targeting you.

**These cookies do not exist on our site**.
