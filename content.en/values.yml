    md: We perform a free study of historical consumption and roof orientation to dimension the exact solar field, avoiding oversizing the installation and optimizing amortization.

    md: With typical residential consumption, the investment is recovered in 4 - 6 years thanks to bill savings and surplus compensation.

    md: We install Type 2 (European standard) single-phase or three-phase equipment up to 22 kW, compatible with all brands - Tesla, Renault, Hyundai, BMW, etc.
  - title: Do I need to increase the contracted power?
    md: Not always. We study your load curve and, if appropriate, install dynamic balancing to avoid exceeding current power and eliminate unnecessary fixed costs.
  - title: How long does the installation and IRVE legalization take?
    md: Physical installation is completed in 3-5 hours; legalization before the distributor and the autonomous community of Murcia is delivered in 24-72 hours.
  - title: Can I share line with other domestic consumptions?

      When one looks for a professional, they want them to be effective.

      I was attended by José María, and you can tell when someone knows their job, as has been the case with José María.

      He has attended and answered each of the doubts I have raised and has gone beyond the assignment made.

      Speed from contact through the form to the visit.

      Efficiency and speed in the repair.

      Price according to the work performed, but it's one of those times when you're also happy with everything in general.

      I keep it as a reference, for whoever asks me.

      José and Juan Manuel did a wonderful job.

      They installed a Tesla Wall Connector with the balancing kit, which was top 👌 I chose them after comparing them with other electricians for inspiring confidence and high professionalism from the first moment, and they exceeded all my expectations until the end.

      Both the installation itself and the communication from start to finish (even the quote is very detailed) and the efficiency, always available and reactive, taking sensible initiatives prioritizing my interest at all times.

      For example, exhaustively advising on the appropriate balancing kit, and working on the discretion of the tubes in common areas.

      They demonstrated extraordinary attention to detail these days, with humility in moments of doubt and actively informing themselves.

      They kept their word without the slightest fault, the truth is I couldn't be more satisfied.

      It's a pleasure to deal with people like this, I wish them the brilliant future they deserve and are earning with vivacity 💪

      I was and still am excited about technimur's performance, while renovating the entire electrical installation of my newly bought house in San Pedro del Pinatar.

      They are highly qualified people, very customer-oriented, friendly and with good knowledge of English.

      They gave me a quote in time and money before placing the order and met the deadlines and costs 100%.

      Really very impressive.

      I will be happy to hire them again.

      I found this company by chance, particularly José María.

      I have not met Spaniards like this in 13 years of living in Spain.

      He is a person of new formation, such service, attention, professionalism, immediate solution to the problem.

      I wish everyone in Spain were so professional!!! My surprise has no limits.

      I will recommend this company to everyone, particularly José María, among my friends and strangers.

      I would like to wish this company much luck and prosperity.

      I am sure this will happen in the near future!!!

      Hello! Our electrical system in our apartment at Hacienda Riquelme went out yesterday Sunday.

      There was a major problem in the basement, so we couldn't do anything.

      We called José from Electricistas Technimur and he came even though it was Sunday and solved the problem.

      We are very grateful and he did a very good job! Thank you very much!
